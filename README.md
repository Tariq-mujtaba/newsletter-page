## Overview

![Newsletter Subscription Form Screenshot](https://github.com/Tariq-mujtaba/newsletter-page/raw/main/resources/Screenshot.png)

This project is a simple and modern newsletter subscription form designed to engage users in subscribing to a newsletter. The form includes a user-friendly interface with an input field for entering an email address, a submit button, and a helper text to reassure the user about privacy. The layout is clean and responsive, ensuring it looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

## What I learned

- **Responsive Design**: I learned how to create a flexible layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring the form remains user-friendly and visually appealing on both large and small screens.
- **CSS Variables**: I utilized CSS custom properties (variables) to manage colors, fonts, and other design elements, which made the styling more maintainable and consistent throughout the page.
- **Flexbox for Centering**: I used Flexbox to center the content both vertically and horizontally, making it easier to create a neat and well-aligned layout.
- **Modern Form Styling**: I gained experience in styling form elements, including input fields and buttons, to create a modern, intuitive design that enhances user experience.
- **Typography with Google Fonts**: I incorporated the "Poppins" font family from Google Fonts to create a modern and clean look for the text.
